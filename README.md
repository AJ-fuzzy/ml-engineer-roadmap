This repository showcases ML/AI skills that I have learned throughout university, organized by structured learning phases and extra projects.
​
The goal is to include curated resources and implement projects that together form a coherent, practical ML/AI portfolio.
​
Objectives:
- Demonstrate end-to-end skills in Python, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and MLOps.
​
- Build a portfolio of real-world projects across computer vision, NLP, and deployment.
​
- Track progress from fundamentals to job-ready ML engineer competencies.
